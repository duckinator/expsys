# so in practice i think i basically am going to have:
#
# - a knowledgebase
# - a collection of agents that feed information into the knowledgebase
# - an inference engine to take the knowledgebase and a pile of rules and
#   determine if there's any fully-resolvable top-level rules
# - some kind of notification system
